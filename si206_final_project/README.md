# SI 206 Final Project

This repo will contain the code for this project, as well as a temporary database to use
for collaboration. Eventually the database will be deleted since the code will create
that itself.

## Instructions

- In a terminal window, execute "python3 main.py" *SIX* times.
- The first five executions slowly populates the database up to 100 rows.
- The sixth and successive executions populates the database arbitrarily with many more rows.
- All \*.png figures and \*csv files are saved in the same directory as main.py.

## Misc Information

- The shared database is called "db.sqlite" and is in the same directory as main.py.
- Four tables exist in the database, two of them relational joined by a foreign key.

## Plan (10 points)

- Still a working document.

## Database (100 points)

## Report

1. Goals for the project (10 points)
2. Goals that were achieved (10 points)
3. Problems we faced (10 points)
4. File(s) of calculations (10 points)
5. Visualizations (10 points)
6. Execution instructions (10 points)
